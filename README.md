Presentation Proposal for BlackHat 2021

## Abstract
At the outset, Time Locks and Time Series Databases are two extreme ends. However there are interesting possibilities to bring them together. In this session, I am presenting a creative convergence of post quantum cryptography powered time locks engineered to secure and scale multi party computation on time series databases in a privacy preserving manner.
