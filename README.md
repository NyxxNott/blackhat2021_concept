Presentation Proposal for BlackHat 2021

## Abstract
At the outset, Time Locks and Time Series Databases are two extreme ends. However there are interesting possibilities to bring them together. In this session, I am presenting a creative convergence of post quantum cryptography powered time locks engineered to secure and scale multi party computation on time series databases in a privacy preserving manner. 

## Narrative
The presentation will consist of sections on time locks and their different manifestations such as verified delay functions, verified random functions, time aggregators and time clock types. The next section will be on the types of time series databases. This section will also cover the core functional and non-functional aspects of time series databases. The subsequent section will outline how different types of recursions are implemented on time lock functions. Then there will be a reference architecture of how time locks can secure time series databases.
